# Tatiana Fokina Resume

This small project includes two versions of my resume: a web page and a PDF.

## Technologies

HTML, [Nunjacks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), CSS, JavaScript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [GitHub workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/).

## Commands

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

The second installation option:

```bash
pnpm install
```

For Windows users run the standalone script and open your IDE or PowerShell as administrator (â€³run as administratorâ€³):

```bash
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

Build HTML:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Generate PDF version based on HTML:

```bash
pnpm run generate-pdf
```

## Caveats

Currently, the PDF version of the CV isn't fully accessible from the box. I'm going to fix it one day but not today ðŸ˜…

Document accessibility issues:

- â€³StructParentâ€³ entry missing the annotation (`<a>`)
- Path object not tagged (`<b>`, `border`, bullet points)
- â€³Linkâ€³ annotation is not nested inside a â€³Linkâ€³ structure element (`<a>`)
- Alternative description missing for an annotation (`<a>`)
- â€³LIâ€³ element must content exactly one â€³LBodyâ€³ element and may contain â€³Lblâ€³ elements (`<ul>`, `<li>`).

[Explanations of issues](https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/en/resources/pac-2024-quality-checks/) ðŸ¤”

For evaluating the accessibility of PDF files I recommended using [PAC (PDF Accessibility Checker)](https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/en/) and screen readers.

## File versioning

Each CV should be tailored to the specific company and job title. Therefore, I have decided to generate a new HTML file and PDF version of my CV for different job descriptions. The file naming convention includes my surname, the keyword â€³CV,â€³ the year the CV was created, and the version number.

The initial and basic version of the CV is named: `Fokina-T-CV_2025V1.0`.

If there is a major change, such as applying for a new job title, the first digit of the version number should increase by one (e.g., V2.0, V3.0, etc.). Other updates are considered minor changes and are indicated by incrementing the second digit (e.g., V1.1, V1.2, V2.1, etc.).
